## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skmpf/homelab
cd homelab
```

2. Copy the `.env` template

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

3. Fill in the required values in the `.env` file:
   - `DOCKERCONFDIR`: Directory for container configuration files
   - `DOCKERSTORAGEDIR`: Directory for storage (if needed)
   - `PUID`: Your user's ID (run `id -u` to find it)
   - `TZ`: Your timezone (e.g., Europe/Paris)
   - `TUNNEL_TOKEN`: Cloudflare tunnel token

4. Start the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Access the web interfaces for each service:
   - AdGuardHome: http://localhost:3000
   - Portainer: http://localhost:9000
   - Uptime Kuma: http://localhost:3001

## Notes

- AdGuardHome runs in host network mode for DNS server functionality
- ZeroTier also runs in host network mode and requires NET_ADMIN capabilities
- Cloudflared requires a tunnel token from Cloudflare
- Watchtower is configured to automatically update all containers at 4 AM daily
- Make sure to create the directories specified for `DOCKERCONFDIR` before starting the services
- All services use the non-root PUID for better security
